# GEV Margins Case Study

This case study explores different approaches to modeling spatial dependence in Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions using Stan.

## Overview

We compare three methods for modeling spatial dependence:

1. Exact Matérn model
2. Folded approximation of Matérn model
3. Circulant approximation of Matérn model
