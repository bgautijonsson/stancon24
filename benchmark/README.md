# GEV Margins Benchmark

This benchmark compares different approaches to modeling spatial dependence in Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions using Stan.

## Overview

We evaluate and compare three methods for modeling spatial dependence:

1. Exact Matérn model
2. Folded approximation of Matérn model
3. Circulant approximation of Matérn model

The benchmark assesses the performance, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these methods in the context of spatial GEV modeling.
